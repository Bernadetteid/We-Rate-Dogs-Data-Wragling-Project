Introduction
The project is for Udacity Nano Degree Data Analysis Program, to test the students ability with data wrangling process.

It's basically for learning purpose, to help better the student's approach and style towards data wrangling.

The step by step procedure has apparently provided the student with a more thorough approach to data wranglinga, which provides the viewer with a better understanding of the process as each step is well detailed and broken down.

Using Python and its libraries, we gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it.

We sampled the "We_Rate_Dog" twitter account, to produce insights in the following dimensions

The dog types that got the highest and lowest rating
The year with the most and least Dog review
The devices that was mostly used for the rating
For the analysis, the following files or dataset were provided:

Twitter_Archive
Twitter_Json
Image_predictions
NB: WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. The ratings has a denominator of 10 with a numerator that has values greater than 10.

The rating numerator is higher because it was disxcovered that the dogs are great dogs.
